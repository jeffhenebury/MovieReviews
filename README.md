Playing with C++
/*
The problem :
Make a program to track what movies I’ve watched, what rating I give them, and automatically logs when I watched it(the day of entry)

The program :

Make a Movie class, which holds the movie’s title, the name of the director, my rating of the movie, and the time and date when the movie was added.
Make a vector called Movies that holds all of the created Movies.
Create a user input method to add the details in, create a new Movie, and add it into the vector

Biggest learning :

Automatically getting the current date in C++ felt really I remember that in Python, it’s quite simple, as seen in this article from programiz.com.In C++, there are a number of steps, and the solution that finally worked for me seems precarious; you basically have to turn off a security warning because of pointer risks.That does not seem like a good long - term solution!If anyone has used a better method, I’d love to hear it.
